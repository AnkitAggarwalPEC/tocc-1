#tocc, a Tool for Obsessive Compulsive Classifers

##Introduction

TOCC is a tag-based file management system. It also includes a tag-based file
system called TOCCFS. The goal of TOCC is to provide a better system for
classifying files, more flexible than classic file systems that are based on a
tree of files and directories.
